# Pravega CLI (DEPRECATED IN THIS REPOSITORY)

Pravega CLI is a tool for inspecting and exploring Pravega deployments. 
**DEPRECATION WARNING**: _The Pravega CLI has been migrated to the Pravega core repo and this
codebase is stale and will be eventually removed. To use Pravega CLI, please refer to https://github.com/pravega/pravega_. 

## Prerequisites

- Java 8+

## Building Pravega CLI

Checkout the source code:

```
git clone https://github.com/pravega/pravega-tools
cd pravega-tools/pravega-cli
```

Build the Pravega CLI tool:

```
./gradlew distTar
```

Unzip the result distribution artifact:

```
cd build/distributions/
tar -xvf pravega-cli.tar
```

You will find the executable file (`pravega-cli`) as well as the default configuration under the
`pravega-cli` directory.

## Executing the Pravega CLI

Next, we show how to use the Pravega CLI tool.

> Before using the Pravega CLI, we first need a Pravega cluster up and running. While the simplest way is the 
[standalone deployment](http://pravega.io/docs/latest/deployment/run-local/), you can explore other ways 
of deploying Pravega in the project's [documentation](http://pravega.io/docs/latest/deployment/deployment/). 

You can run the Pravega CLI as follows:
```
./bin/pravega-cli
```
You will se an output related to the default configuration parameters available at `conf/config.properties`
(you may want to change this file according to your setting):
```
Pravega CLI.

Initial configuration:
	cli.tlsEnabled=false
	cli.controllerRestUri=localhost:9091
	cli.authEnabled=false
	bookkeeper.bkLedgerPath=/pravega/pravega/bookkeeper/ledgers
	cli.security.tls.trustStore.location=./conf/client.truststore.jks
	pravegaservice.zkURL=localhost:4000
	pravegaservice.clusterName=pravega
	cli.metadataBackend=segmentstore
	cli.controllerGrpcUri=localhost:9090
	cli.userName=admin
	cli.password=1111_aaaa
	pravegaservice.containerCount=4
```
From that point onwards, you can check the available commands typing `help`:
``` 
> help
All available commands:
        bk cleanup : Removes orphan BookKeeper Ledgers that are not used by any BookKeeperLog.
        bk details <log-id>: Lists metadata details about a BookKeeperLog, including BK Ledger information.
        bk disable <log-id>: Disables a BookKeeperLog by open-fencing it and updating its metadata in ZooKeeper (with the Enabled flag set to 'false').
        bk enable <log-id>: Enables a BookKeeperLog by updating its metadata in ZooKeeper (with the Enabled flag set to 'true').
        bk list : Lists all BookKeeper Logs.
        cluster list-instances : Lists all nodes in the Pravega cluster (Controllers, Segment Stores).
        cluster list-containers: Lists all the containers in the Pravega cluster and the Segment Stores responsible for them.
        cluster get-host-by-container: Get the Segment Store host responsible for a given container id.
        config list : Lists all configuration set during this session.
        config set <name=value list>: Sets one or more config values for use during this session.
        container recover <container-id>: Executes a local, non-invasive recovery for a SegmentContainer.
        controller describe-readergroup <scope-name> <readergroup-id>: Get the details of a given ReaderGroup in a Scope.
        controller describe-scope <scope-name>: Get the details of a given Scope.
        controller describe-stream <scope-name> <stream-name>: Get the details of a given Stream.
        controller list-readergroups <scope-name>: Lists all the existing ReaderGroups in a given Scope.
        controller list-scopes : Lists all the existing scopes in the system.
        controller list-streams <scope-name>: Lists all the existing Streams in a given Scope.
```
And execute any of them:
```
> controller list-scopes
{"scopes":[{"scopeName":"_system"},{"scopeName":"streamsinscope"}]}

> controller list-readergroups _system
{"readerGroups":[{"readerGroupName":"abortStreamReaders"},{"readerGroupName":"scaleGroup"},{"readerGroupName":"commitStreamReaders"}]}
```

You can also execute the Pravega CLI in "batch mode" by passing a command directly as a parameter:
```
./bin/pravega-cli controller list-scopes
Pravega CLI.

Initial configuration:
        pravegaservice.zkURL=localhost:2181
        bookkeeper.bkLedgerPath=/pravega/pravega-cluster/bookkeeper/ledgers
        pravegaservice.containerCount=4
        cli.controllerRestUri=http://localhost:9091
        pravegaservice.clusterName=pravega-cluster
{"scopes":[{"scopeName":"_system"},{"scopeName":"streamsinscope"}]}
```

Note that if you are using the standalone deployment, Bookkeeper commands (and others) will not be 
available. For this reason, we encourage you to go a step further and deploy a full Pravega cluster to 
explore the whole functionality of Pravega CLI.
